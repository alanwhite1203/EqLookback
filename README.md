# EqLookback
A lookback option gives the option holder the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at the lowest price. It pays a single call-option-style payoff based on the performance of the underlying assetâ€™s final price relative to its initial price, where both the initial and final prices are computed using a lookback formula.
